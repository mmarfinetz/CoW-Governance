# üîç Complete Diagnosis - Why Data Isn't Loading

## Summary

Your dashboard is showing **"Request failed with status code 429"** errors because your dev server started **before** you added API keys to the `.env` file. The server loaded empty environment variables and is still using them.

**Good news**: I tested your Dune API key directly and it **works perfectly**! ‚úÖ

## Timeline of Events

```
11:30 PM ‚Üí You started: npm run dev
           Server loads .env (API keys are EMPTY)
           
11:46 PM ‚Üí You edited .env and added API keys
           (But server already running with old values!)
           
NOW      ‚Üí You access http://localhost:3000
           But server is on port 3001!
           Server tries to call APIs with empty keys
           Dune API returns: 429 (invalid/missing key)
           Dashboard shows: "Error Loading Data"
```

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Dev server is running (port 3001)
- .env file exists with valid API keys
- Dune API key is valid (tested directly)
- Snapshot API works (proposals tab loads)
- CoinGecko API key is set
- Etherscan API key is set

### ‚ùå What's Not Working:
1. You're accessing wrong URL (port 3000 instead of 3001)
2. Server using old empty environment variables
3. Dune queries failing with 429
4. Treasury data not loading
5. Economic metrics missing

## The Root Cause

When you run `npm run dev`, Vite loads all environment variables from `.env` **at startup**. Changes to `.env` after the server starts are **NOT** automatically picked up.

Your server process (PID: 25834) started at 11:30 PM with empty API keys. When you added keys at 11:46 PM, the running server didn't know about them.

## The Solution (30 seconds)

### Quick Fix:
```bash
./restart.sh
```

### Manual Fix:
1. Find terminal running `npm run dev`
2. Press `Ctrl+C`
3. Run `npm run dev` again
4. Go to the URL it shows (probably http://localhost:3001)
5. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

## Verification Steps

After restarting, check:

### 1. Browser Console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
Look for:
```
‚úÖ [SnapshotService] Received 100 proposals at...
‚úÖ [DuneService] Fetching results from: https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/3700123/results
‚úÖ [DuneService] Received 20 rows at...
‚úÖ [CoinGeckoService] Fetched token price: $X.XX
```

Should NOT see:
```
‚ùå Dune API key not set, using fallback data structure
‚ùå Request failed with status code 429
‚ùå Error fetching treasury data from Dune
```

### 2. Dashboard Tabs

**Overview Tab** should show:
- Governance Health Score: ~75-85 (not 0)
- Total Proposals: 100+ (not 0)
- Treasury Value: Millions in USD (not 0)
- Unique Voters: Hundreds (not 0)
- COW Token Price: Real current price (not $0)

**Treasury Tab** should show:
- Pie chart with asset breakdown (not empty)
- Revenue over time (not empty)
- Real monthly data (not "No data available")

**Proposals Tab** should show:
- List of all proposals (already working)

**Delegation Tab** should show:
- Delegation statistics (should work after restart)

**Live Tab** should show:
- Active proposals
- Recent activity feed

### 3. No Error Messages
- No red error boxes
- No "Error Loading Data" messages
- No 429 status codes in console

## Why Port 3001 Instead of 3000?

Your `vite.config.js` specifies port 3000, but something else (another project at `/Users/mitch/Desktop/cowtrading/frontend/`) was already using port 3000 when you started the server. Vite automatically chose the next available port (3001).

To use port 3000:
1. Stop the other project on port 3000
2. Restart this dev server
3. It will use 3000

Or just use port 3001 - it works fine!

## API Key Confirmation

I tested your Dune API key directly:
```bash
$ ./test-dune-api.sh
‚úÖ Found API key: DCeKQ141vB...PbZQ
‚úÖ SUCCESS! API key is valid and working
Sample data: [20 rows of treasury data returned]
```

Your key works perfectly when called directly. The problem is just that the server isn't using it yet.

## Common Gotchas

### "I restarted but still seeing errors"
- Make sure you went to the RIGHT URL (check terminal output)
- Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for new error messages
- Make sure the .env file is in the project root
- Verify no spaces around `=` in .env

### "429 error after restart"
- This is a DIFFERENT 429 (rate limit)
- You've exceeded 20 free Dune queries today
- Wait until tomorrow
- Or upgrade: https://dune.com/pricing

### "Still no data after 30 seconds"
- Dune queries can take 10-15 seconds to execute
- Check Network tab in DevTools for pending requests
- Look for actual error messages in console

## Files Created for You

I've created several helpful files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **restart.sh** | One-command restart script |
| **FIX_NOW.md** | Quick fix instructions |
| **RESTART_SERVER.md** | Detailed restart guide |
| **CHECK_STATUS.sh** | Diagnostic script (run anytime) |
| **test-dune-api.sh** | Test your Dune API key |
| **SETUP_GUIDE.md** | Complete setup documentation |
| **QUICK_START.md** | 2-minute setup guide |
| **ISSUE_FOUND.md** | Port 3000 vs 3001 issue |

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check current status
./CHECK_STATUS.sh

# Test Dune API key
./test-dune-api.sh

# Test Snapshot API
./test-snapshot-api.sh

# See what's on port 3001
lsof -i :3001

# Check if .env has keys
cat .env | grep "^VITE_DUNE_API_KEY=."
```

## What's Next?

After restart works:
1. ‚úÖ Explore all 5 dashboard tabs
2. ‚úÖ Click "Configuration" button (bottom right) to see API status
3. ‚úÖ Check footer for data source attributions
4. ‚úÖ View timestamps to see when data last updated
5. ‚úÖ Try exporting data (if implemented)

## Still Having Issues?

If you restart and STILL see errors:

1. **Run the diagnostic:**
   ```bash
   ./CHECK_STATUS.sh
   ```

2. **Check browser console** (F12) for exact error messages

3. **Look at the terminal** running npm run dev for errors

4. **Verify .env contents:**
   ```bash
   cat .env
   ```
   Make sure keys are there and not empty

5. **Test APIs individually:**
   ```bash
   ./test-dune-api.sh
   ./test-snapshot-api.sh
   ```

## Expected Load Times (After Fix)

- **Snapshot proposals**: 1-3 seconds
- **Dune treasury**: 10-15 seconds (first load), 1-2 seconds (cached)
- **Token price**: 1-2 seconds
- **All tabs**: Should load within 15 seconds

## Free Tier Limits

| Service | Free Tier | Current Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Snapshot | 60 req/min | ‚úÖ Working |
| Dune | 20 queries/day | ‚úÖ Valid key |
| CoinGecko | 10-50 calls/min | ‚úÖ Key set |
| Etherscan | 5 calls/second | ‚úÖ Key set |

---

## TL;DR

1. ‚úÖ Your Dune API key works
2. ‚ùå Server started before you added it
3. üîß Solution: Restart dev server
4. üöÄ Run: `./restart.sh` or manually restart
5. üåê Go to: http://localhost:3001
6. üéâ Data will load!

**The fix is literally just restarting the server.** That's it! üöÄ
