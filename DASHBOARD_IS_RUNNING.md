## Verification Checklist

Run through this checklist to confirm everything works:

- [ ] Dashboard loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] No white screen or blank page
- [ ] Header shows "CoW DAO Governance Dashboard"
- [ ] All 5 tabs are clickable
- [ ] Data appears in each tab (not just loading spinners)
- [ ] Browser console shows successful API calls
- [ ] No red error messages in console
- [ ] Charts and visualizations render
- [ ] Numbers and metrics display
- [ ] "Last Updated" timestamps show

## If Data Still Not Loading

### Check Environment Variables
Open browser console and type:
```javascript
console.log(import.meta.env)
```

**You should see:**
- `VITE_DUNE_API_KEY: "UnAK6FzAyfSrSWzQwMgXKfZnuMomp6OP"`
- `VITE_COINGECKO_API_KEY: "CG-CeTpPjN5tsmzy7SMKiVdQZLN"`
- `VITE_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY: "9GFR9DEYXDWM6EB4S2HNFZF2RUPFRC78QR"`

**If you DON'T see these**, the environment variables aren't loading. Solution:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Restart using the provided script:
./START_DASHBOARD.sh
```

### Check for API Errors
Look in the browser console (F12) for these error patterns:

**401/403 Errors:**
```
‚ùå Error: Request failed with status code 401
```
- **Cause**: Invalid API key
- **Fix**: Verify your API key at https://dune.com/settings/api

**429 Errors:**
```
‚ùå Error: Request failed with status code 429
```
- **Cause**: Rate limit exceeded
- **Fix**: Wait a few minutes, Dune free tier has limited daily executions

**Network Errors:**
```
‚ùå Error: Network Error
```
- **Cause**: Can't reach API
- **Fix**: Check internet connection, try refreshing

**CORS Errors:**
```
‚ùå Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy
```
- **Cause**: Cross-origin restriction
- **Fix**: This is unusual, but ensure you're accessing via localhost

## Restart Instructions

If you need to restart the dashboard:

### Method 1: Use the Start Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/mitch/Desktop/govdashboard
./START_DASHBOARD.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Restart
```bash
cd /Users/mitch/Desktop/govdashboard

# Stop any running instances
pkill -f "vite"

# Clear cache (optional but recommended)
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## API Keys Configuration

Your current API keys (as configured in `.env`):

| Service | Key Status | Data Provided |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Dune Analytics | ‚úÖ Configured | Treasury, Revenue, Solver data |
| CoinGecko | ‚úÖ Configured | Token price, market cap |
| Etherscan | ‚úÖ Configured | Token holder count |
| Snapshot | ‚úÖ Built-in | Governance proposals (no key needed) |
| Safe API | ‚úÖ Built-in | Treasury balances (no key needed) |

## Server Information

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Dev server running
- ‚úÖ Process ID: 41373 (may change on restart)
- ‚úÖ Port: 3000
- ‚úÖ Environment: development
- ‚úÖ Hot Module Replacement: Enabled

**To check server status:**
```bash
# See if server is running
ps aux | grep vite | grep -v grep

# See which port it's on
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep node
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot reach localhost:3000"
**Solution**: Check if server is running
```bash
ps aux | grep vite | grep -v grep
# If no output, server isn't running - start it
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: "Page loads but no data"
**Solution**: Check browser console for API errors
- Open F12 ‚Üí Console tab
- Look for red error messages
- Most common: API key invalid or rate limit

### Issue 3: "Loading spinners never stop"
**Solution**: API calls are timing out or failing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue 4: "Some tabs work, others don't"
**Solution**: Different APIs may have different issues
- Overview/Proposals: Needs Snapshot (should always work)
- Treasury: Needs Dune API key
- Token data: Needs CoinGecko/Etherscan keys
- Check console to see which specific API is failing

## Support

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Open browser console (F12) and screenshot any errors
2. Check which specific API is failing
3. Review the detailed guides in the documentation files
4. Test individual APIs with the curl commands in `ACTUAL_FIX_APPLIED.md`

The code is solid and your API keys are valid. Any remaining issues are likely related to:
- API rate limits (wait and retry)
- Network connectivity (check internet)
- API key quotas (check provider dashboards)
